        , "This is because, currently, GPT-4 Turbo cannot transcribe videos directly, so we have to break it down into a series of images first, like a slideshow verison of the video."
        , "The idea is to give GPT-4 enough context, along with any user settings like style and persona, to understand the video and generate detailed a transcription."

        [ "Here we are using a stock video of a penalty shootout to generate some VoiceOver commentry for it. The twist being that we can choose from a variety of voices and styles."
        , "We can choose the style to be a poem, and the persona to be of David Attinborough. The result is what you see here in the gif, a decent attempt at a poetic commentary of the penalty shootout in the video (full video below)."
        , "The commentry is impressively accurate to what is going on in the video - inferring that its of an indoor penalty shootout for starters - and takes into account the sequence of events, like the striker stepping forwad and the keeper subsequently crouching. All these details are picked up and written into the poem."
        , "This is a testament to GPT-4's inference capabilities, and why it is so powerful for many use cases, generating VoiceOver being one of them."
        , "Of course you don't have to make GPT follow a particular style or persona, you could fine-tune the model however you'd like to get the results you want. The possibilities are endless."
